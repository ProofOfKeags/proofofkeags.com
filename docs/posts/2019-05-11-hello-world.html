        <p>Because what the hell else was my first post going to be? Hi. My name is Keagan, or possibly more
recognizably “CaptJakk” online. I have been wanting to spin up a blog for some time, and never made
the time for it. So, finally, here it is. The reason I finally got around to doing this is I have
my second <a href="https://lambdaconf.zohobackstage.com/LambdaConf2019?lang=en#/agenda?day=3&amp;lang=en&amp;sessionId=6967000000359734">LC</a>
talk coming up, and wanted to get a draft of that talk down on paper in an essay
like format first. I also wanted the essay version to be posted here.</p>
<p>In the future you can expect a few different categories of posts and I’ll try to find some way to
partition them as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophy: musings about how I choose to operate in my day to day life and how I make large
decisions. This is probably more for me than any of you, but perhaps others could benefit.</li>
<li>Economics/Game Theory: much of this will be related to cryptocurrencies and the economic theory
that goes into designing them, but also occasionally stuff related to financial markets.</li>
<li>Functional Programming: This is likely to be the main focus of what I talk about here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I have this intro out of the way, it’s time to start the first draft of my talk.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
